This story takes place way before all the excellent tools we currently have to help
us achieve brilliant and innovative tools.

Let me give you some context, I got my first computer when I was 15 years old, a
little late in life to be honest, but I fell in love at first sight, I did not
spend 24/7 because my mom would not let me.

### School, yeah right.

I dropped out of school when I was 17 years old, at that time I was spending
most of my time playing Counter-Strike when I should’ve spent it learning how
to code, a naive child I was. I spent 1 year of my life doing absolutely
nothing. At 18, I got an ultimatum from my mom. I had to get a job, right away.

### First Job
A month later I started working in a warehouse, picking up products to send to the
central stores, I worked there for 2 years when I decided I had to do something, I was
not willing to work there my whole life. So I co-founded a startup with a friend of mine,
my primary role was UI / UX, but quickly had to move into the development department.
I had started learning PHP while working in the warehouse at the same time.

### Do what you love
I never looked back, I now have a ~ 10-year career and can’t be happier. I have
learned a lot in the past 10 years, I have moved from PHP to Ruby on Rails. Back
in the day, we used MooTools instead of jQuery, but we ended up switching to
jQuery at the end.

---

I have learned about jQuery, CoffeeScript, AngularJS, and most recently ReactJS, Redux, GraphQL, etc.;
